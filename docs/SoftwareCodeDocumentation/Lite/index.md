# Lightweight web site

The lite web site is a server rendered application based on django to interact with the functionalities of Writing Tabula Rasa using a simple and resourceless web interface.

## Objective

The objective of this UI is to be an accessible and fast method to approach the core functionalities of the project, so it can be used in low end devices and/or low connection situations. Unlike the web app it doesn't focus on user experience but in reliability and speed.

It's idea is to not require high end hardware by splitting the intensity of the UI drawing from the client using the hosting computer as a helper and crude interface.

### Pros:
- Quick connection
- Doesn't use much resources
- Server rendered
- Straightforward

### Cons
- Lack of style
- Poor accessibility
- Raw controls
