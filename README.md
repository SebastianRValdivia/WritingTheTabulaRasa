# Tabula Rasa Project

### IN DEVELOPEMENT DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET

Writing the Tabula Rasa is a study system and an information organizer. It's aimed at students of any type, with the goal of helping in their task of learning.

The software development is guided by the book *Writing the Blank Tabula* which can be read for free here. The proposed tools and features are taken from this book, any improvements must be referenced from it. The book follows a version system that allows it to adapt to changes. Anyone can start a discussion about the book by creating an issue and expressing their point of view in an academic way, citing sources and explaining their position.
