<p>Dedicated to all those who, in the face of any difficulty, chose to
keep learning.</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>As a child, my mother urged me to study, and for a considerable
stretch of my life, I regarded this task as the mere memorization of
answers to exams, only to promptly forget them once the obligation was
fulfilled. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I encountered a
semester-long course called ‘study techniques.’ Here, I was instructed
to read, underline, reread, and rewrite my underlined notes. While this
method improved my exam scores temporarily, the knowledge would
invariably fade away afterward. Historical facts became meaningless
dates, equations dissolved into scribbles, and once-learned language
concepts transformed into loathsome words drifting in my memory.
Remarkably, I continued to pass with excellent grades.</p>
<p>However, my understanding of the true cost of this approach only
dawned on me when I entered engineering university. The initial exams
were designed merely to assess my knowledge level, but when I read the
questions, I recognized them from somewhere in my past. I had known them
years ago, but now they seemed vaguely familiar, and I struggled to
provide the correct answers. My score? A mere 20%. As the coursework
advanced, my situation deteriorated. I needed to grasp earlier concepts
to excel in exams, a prospect that had never piqued my interest.
Moreover, the study techniques that had served me previously proved
inadequate in the face of the substantial amount of information I now
encountered. I barely managed to pass, and by the time I reached my
second year, where retaining previously learned concepts was essential,
I faltered. Everything I had learned the prior year had vanished from
memory.</p>
<p>I began to doubt my abilities, believing I was inherently incapable
and that my brain was somehow inferior. I ultimately abandoned my
university studies, deeming them a waste of time. My goals shifted, and
I started working as a barista. However, my thirst for knowledge
remained unquenched. Numerous subjects, particularly programming,
continued to captivate my interest. Encouraged by this spark, I decided
to embark on a self-guided journey to deepen my understanding of the
field.</p>
<p>This path was fraught with stumbling blocks, errors, and challenges,
but gradually, programming started to make sense. Beyond that, I began
to discern a pattern in the learning process. I turned to dynamic
tutorials that emphasized hands-on experience over the rote memorization
of definitions or complex theories. This new approach kindled a fresh
curiosity within me: How do we learn?</p>
<p>I set out on a quest to uncover alternative methods of studying. My
initial task was to gather information on effective study techniques. I
scoured the internet for articles, acquired books of interest (often
more than necessary), consulted online communities, and experimented
extensively. My endeavors to learn programming proved particularly
illuminating; while some approaches failed, others succeeded. I
persisted in refining my learning skills until I gained the confidence
to reattempt formal education. This time, I did not falter. Each passing
year proved more productive, and I found myself surpassing both my peers
and even some of my professors. Many attributed my success to sheer
intelligence, willpower, or time spent studying. Yet, they were
mistaken; I had simply mastered the art of effective learning.</p>
<p>Over time, I noticed a significant enhancement in my comprehension
abilities. I grew restless studying a single topic and began to tackle
two or three simultaneously. I explored diverse disciplines, from
programming and languages to carpentry, electricity, electronics,
mathematics, and many others, including seemingly unrelated subjects
like beekeeping and horticulture. This multifaceted approach felt
effortless and enjoyable, compelling me to continue my eclectic learning
journey.</p>
<p>What remains paramount is my unwavering commitment to learning how to
learn. I reached a juncture where I amalgamated my accumulated
knowledge, formal education, and independent discoveries to assist
others in achieving their learning goals.</p>
<p>But why do we learn? Often, people associate learning with
institutions, degrees, and job prospects, neglecting the value of
learning for its intrinsic worth. Learning instills new values, nurtures
our ethics, enhances our productivity by acquainting us with new trades
and hobbies, imparts wisdom from history to prevent repeating past
mistakes, and so much more. Learning doesn’t merely boost our
intelligence; it shapes us into better individuals.</p>
<p>From infancy, we begin to cultivate the skill of learning. Babies
utter their first words after repeated exposure to their parents’
voices, and this process continues throughout their lives. Schooling
exposes them to new knowledge simply by observing teachers, acquainting
them with games by watching peers, and etching book plots into their
memory through reading. This childhood development lays the foundation
for various learning styles and information retention techniques.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Within the pages of this book, we embark on a profound exploration of
the intricacies of learning, delving deep into the modus operandi of our
minds. Our mission is to unravel the secrets of understanding and
memorizing information with the ultimate goal of enhancing our cognitive
capabilities and extracting knowledge in the most lucid and meticulously
organized manner.</p>
<p>In this quest for cognitive mastery, we encounter a rich tapestry of
methods and intricate systems meticulously crafted by experts. These
tools serve as catalysts, propelling us toward heightened efficacy in
our learning endeavors. Learning, as we come to appreciate, transcends
the mere act of reading; it demands an amalgamation of willpower,
strategic finesse, relentless practice, and the wisdom to discern the
most effective pathways to knowledge acquisition.</p>
<p>The voyage of recollection, an integral facet of the learning
process, unfolds as a cyclic odyssey, replete with twists and turns, for
which we must be well-prepared. Once we acquire knowledge, our brains
undergo transformative processes akin to molding clay into new forms.
However, this remarkable property of neuroplasticity comes with its own
set of challenges. The specter of forgetting looms, albeit not
indefinitely or abruptly. Under specific conditions, the precious fruits
of our learning can slip away. To combat this formidable adversary, we
wield a powerful weapon: the art of notation. Within our arsenal, we
find an array of mechanisms, both simple and intricate, swift or
detailed, all finely tuned to transcribe information with precision and
purpose.</p>
<p>For those who may question the efficacy of the written word, there
exists an alternative avenue of learning: the art of meticulously
crafting organized visualizations. Diagramming, as we shall discover,
demands an intimate understanding of the nuanced art of explicit and
systematic description within a pristine canvas of blank space. Yet, be
not deceived, for the mere act of tracing lines upon a canvas is
insufficient to conjure meaningful charts and diagrams. What lies at the
heart of this endeavor is an adherence to order and an unwavering
dedication to the art’s guiding principles and regulations.</p>
<p>In essence, this odyssey through the realms of learning not only
equips us with the tools to ascend the peaks of knowledge but also
instills a profound sense of reverence for the process itself. Learning,
we come to realize, transcends the confines of institutions, degrees,
and employment prospects. It is the crucible in which we forge our
values, nurture our ethics, and expand our horizons. Learning transforms
us into not just more intelligent beings but, fundamentally, into better
individuals.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tabula-rasa">¿What is “tabula rasa”?</h3>
<p>The term “tabula rasa,” Latin for “blank slate,” carries profound
philosophical significance. It encapsulates the notion that each of us
enters the world devoid of inherent knowledge, akin to an empty canvas,
and it is through the journey of life that we inscribe our experiences
upon this mental canvas, gradually etching the tapestry of our
understanding.</p>
<p>The origin of this term draws a compelling parallel to a tool of
antiquity—the Roman wax tablet. Employed by the Romans in the 1st
century B.C., this tablet could be molded afresh with a stylus,
permitting the erasure of previous writings and enabling the opportunity
to transcribe anew. Its very emptiness led to its designation as “rasa,”
signifying the absence of preexisting inscriptions.</p>
<p>In essence, “tabula rasa” stands as a testament to the malleability
of human consciousness, where the imprints of life’s experiences
continually shape and reshape the contours of our understanding,
rendering each of us a unique work of intellectual artistry.</p>

<p>Philosophers employed this expression to symbolize the commencement
of learning from birth, following the theory of empiricism, which posits
that we acquire knowledge through experience from the moment we are
born. Here, we align ourselves with this ideology, keeping our doors
open to all. What is explained remains indifferent to one’s origin,
current circumstances, reasons for wanting to learn, or any other
factors.</p>
