<p>Dedicated to all those who, in the face of any difficulty, chose to
keep learning.</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>As a child, my mother urged me to study, and for a considerable
stretch of my life, I regarded this task as the mere memorization of
answers to exams, only to promptly forget them once the obligation was
fulfilled. It wasn’t until my teenage years that I encountered a
semester-long course called ‘study techniques.’ Here, I was instructed
to read, underline, reread, and rewrite my underlined notes. While this
method improved my exam scores temporarily, the knowledge would
invariably fade away afterward. Historical facts became meaningless
dates, equations dissolved into scribbles, and once-learned language
concepts transformed into loathsome words drifting in my memory.
Remarkably, I continued to pass with excellent grades.</p>
<p>However, my understanding of the true cost of this approach only
dawned on me when I entered engineering university. The initial exams
were designed merely to assess my knowledge level, but when I read the
questions, I recognized them from somewhere in my past. I had known them
years ago, but now they seemed vaguely familiar, and I struggled to
provide the correct answers. My score? A mere 20%. As the coursework
advanced, my situation deteriorated. I needed to grasp earlier concepts
to excel in exams, a prospect that had never piqued my interest.
Moreover, the study techniques that had served me previously proved
inadequate in the face of the substantial amount of information I now
encountered. I barely managed to pass, and by the time I reached my
second year, where retaining previously learned concepts was essential,
I faltered. Everything I had learned the prior year had vanished from
memory.</p>
<p>I began to doubt my abilities, believing I was inherently incapable
and that my brain was somehow inferior. I ultimately abandoned my
university studies, deeming them a waste of time. My goals shifted, and
I started working as a barista. However, my thirst for knowledge
remained unquenched. Numerous subjects, particularly programming,
continued to captivate my interest. Encouraged by this spark, I decided
to embark on a self-guided journey to deepen my understanding of the
field.</p>
<p>This path was fraught with stumbling blocks, errors, and challenges,
but gradually, programming started to make sense. Beyond that, I began
to discern a pattern in the learning process. I turned to dynamic
tutorials that emphasized hands-on experience over the rote memorization
of definitions or complex theories. This new approach kindled a fresh
curiosity within me: How do we learn?</p>
<p>I set out on a quest to uncover alternative methods of studying. My
initial task was to gather information on effective study techniques. I
scoured the internet for articles, acquired books of interest (often
more than necessary), consulted online communities, and experimented
extensively. My endeavors to learn programming proved particularly
illuminating; while some approaches failed, others succeeded. I
persisted in refining my learning skills until I gained the confidence
to reattempt formal education. This time, I did not falter. Each passing
year proved more productive, and I found myself surpassing both my peers
and even some of my professors. Many attributed my success to sheer
intelligence, willpower, or time spent studying. Yet, they were
mistaken; I had simply mastered the art of effective learning.</p>
<p>Over time, I noticed a significant enhancement in my comprehension
abilities. I grew restless studying a single topic and began to tackle
two or three simultaneously. I explored diverse disciplines, from
programming and languages to carpentry, electricity, electronics,
mathematics, and many others, including seemingly unrelated subjects
like beekeeping and horticulture. This multifaceted approach felt
effortless and enjoyable, compelling me to continue my eclectic learning
journey.</p>
<p>What remains paramount is my unwavering commitment to learning how to
learn. I reached a juncture where I amalgamated my accumulated
knowledge, formal education, and independent discoveries to assist
others in achieving their learning goals.</p>
<p>But why do we learn? Often, people associate learning with
institutions, degrees, and job prospects, neglecting the value of
learning for its intrinsic worth. Learning instills new values, nurtures
our ethics, enhances our productivity by acquainting us with new trades
and hobbies, imparts wisdom from history to prevent repeating past
mistakes, and so much more. Learning doesn’t merely boost our
intelligence; it shapes us into better individuals.</p>
<p>From infancy, we begin to cultivate the skill of learning. Babies
utter their first words after repeated exposure to their parents’
voices, and this process continues throughout their lives. Schooling
exposes them to new knowledge simply by observing teachers, acquainting
them with games by watching peers, and etching book plots into their
memory through reading. This childhood development lays the foundation
for various learning styles and information retention techniques.</p>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Within the pages of this book, we embark on a profound exploration of
the intricacies of learning, delving deep into the modus operandi of our
minds. Our mission is to unravel the secrets of understanding and
memorizing information with the ultimate goal of enhancing our cognitive
capabilities and extracting knowledge in the most lucid and meticulously
organized manner.</p>
<p>In this quest for cognitive mastery, we encounter a rich tapestry of
methods and intricate systems meticulously crafted by experts. These
tools serve as catalysts, propelling us toward heightened efficacy in
our learning endeavors. Learning, as we come to appreciate, transcends
the mere act of reading; it demands an amalgamation of willpower,
strategic finesse, relentless practice, and the wisdom to discern the
most effective pathways to knowledge acquisition.</p>
<p>The voyage of recollection, an integral facet of the learning
process, unfolds as a cyclic odyssey, replete with twists and turns, for
which we must be well-prepared. Once we acquire knowledge, our brains
undergo transformative processes akin to molding clay into new forms.
However, this remarkable property of neuroplasticity comes with its own
set of challenges. The specter of forgetting looms, albeit not
indefinitely or abruptly. Under specific conditions, the precious fruits
of our learning can slip away. To combat this formidable adversary, we
wield a powerful weapon: the art of notation. Within our arsenal, we
find an array of mechanisms, both simple and intricate, swift or
detailed, all finely tuned to transcribe information with precision and
purpose.</p>
<p>For those who may question the efficacy of the written word, there
exists an alternative avenue of learning: the art of meticulously
crafting organized visualizations. Diagramming, as we shall discover,
demands an intimate understanding of the nuanced art of explicit and
systematic description within a pristine canvas of blank space. Yet, be
not deceived, for the mere act of tracing lines upon a canvas is
insufficient to conjure meaningful charts and diagrams. What lies at the
heart of this endeavor is an adherence to order and an unwavering
dedication to the art’s guiding principles and regulations.</p>
<p>In essence, this odyssey through the realms of learning not only
equips us with the tools to ascend the peaks of knowledge but also
instills a profound sense of reverence for the process itself. Learning,
we come to realize, transcends the confines of institutions, degrees,
and employment prospects. It is the crucible in which we forge our
values, nurture our ethics, and expand our horizons. Learning transforms
us into not just more intelligent beings but, fundamentally, into better
individuals.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tabula-rasa">¿What is “tabula rasa”?</h3>
<p>The term “tabula rasa,” Latin for “blank slate,” carries profound
philosophical significance. It encapsulates the notion that each of us
enters the world devoid of inherent knowledge, akin to an empty canvas,
and it is through the journey of life that we inscribe our experiences
upon this mental canvas, gradually etching the tapestry of our
understanding.</p>
<p>The origin of this term draws a compelling parallel to a tool of
antiquity—the Roman wax tablet. Employed by the Romans in the 1st
century B.C., this tablet could be molded afresh with a stylus,
permitting the erasure of previous writings and enabling the opportunity
to transcribe anew. Its very emptiness led to its designation as “rasa,”
signifying the absence of preexisting inscriptions.</p>
<p>In essence, “tabula rasa” stands as a testament to the malleability
of human consciousness, where the imprints of life’s experiences
continually shape and reshape the contours of our understanding,
rendering each of us a unique work of intellectual artistry.</p>

</div>
<p>Philosophers employed this expression to symbolize the commencement
of learning from birth, following the theory of empiricism, which posits
that we acquire knowledge through experience from the moment we are
born. Here, we align ourselves with this ideology, keeping our doors
open to all. What is explained remains indifferent to one’s origin,
current circumstances, reasons for wanting to learn, or any other
factors.</p>
<h2 id="general-view">General view</h2>
<p>Writing the Tabula Rasa is a metaphorical title for the content we
will delve into. Firstly, we will approach it’s figurative meaning,
aiming to comprehend how the human mind operates and how individuals
acquire knowledge. After this metaphorical exploration, we will take a
literal approach and craft the ‘table’ creating a record of our
knowledge to facilitate recollection and interpretation by others.</p>
<p>The text is structured into three primary sections, each addressing
key questions: How does our brain function? How do we learn and memorize
it’s concepts? And, lastly, how do we disseminate and organize this
information?</p>
<p>In the first section, we will delve into the biology of neurons,
dissecting their components and understanding how they interconnect to
construct mental models. We will also explore the concept of ‘attention’
and the pivotal role of cultivating effective study habits.</p>
<p>The second section delves into the realms of study, memorization, and
information retrieval. This domain is vast and intricate, reliant on the
application of techniques across a process that leads to the
comprehension and interconnection of concepts, culminating in their
retention within memory. This journey takes time and cannot be
accomplished in a single night.</p>
<p>Finally, we elucidate the process of disseminating information to
make it reusable, both for oneself and others. We analyze the abstract
organization of information, emphasize the importance of precision in
writing and present various methods for articulating ideas
effectively.</p>
<p>I have endeavored to present this book in an accessible manner,
though it may still pose challenges for those less accustomed to
extensive reading. Whether you are an expert or a novice, remember:
strive to maintain a holistic perspective. Keep in mind the previously
discussed topics and return to them as needed. Comprehending the
connections is paramount to grasping the underpinnings of more advanced
sections.</p>

<h1 id="a.-understanding-the-mind">A. Understanding the mind</h1>
<p>The human brain is the most intricate organ in the animal kingdom,
brimming with mysteries that have intrigued various disciplines
dedicated to unraveling them. The task of thinking is carried out by
tiny, specialized cells that work together in a structured and organized
manner, much like bees. Each area of this remarkable organ performs a
highly specific function.</p>
<p>But why should we be interested in knowing this? This is where
knowledge is brewed. Understanding how it functions enables us to
comprehend how it operates, what it’s limits are and how it thinks.
However, the goal is not to become neuroscientists; people can drive a
vehicle without being mechanics.</p>
<p>We will explore the composition of the brain at the cellular level as
it forms systems, eventually culminating in something larger. We will
focus on an organic perspective before delving into the workings of what
we will cover in the second part.</p>
<h2 id="a.1-how-does-the-brain-work">A.1 How does the brain work?</h2>
<p>The first step in comprehending the mind is to delve into the
neuronal system within our brain, which enables us to think, remember,
and understand. This peculiar organ located in our head is composed of
several parts, each serving various functions. Nonetheless, our focus
isn’t on knowing each part individually but rather on how they come
together to form the human mind.</p>
<p>Before delving into the biological aspects, we will employ an analogy
to ease the complexity, allowing us to perceive the operations of our
brain from a different perspective.</p>
<h3 id="a.1.1-a-tiny-city">A.1.1 A tiny city</h3>
<p>Imagine the mind as a miniature, microscopic city inside your head,
complete with people, streets and buildings.</p>
<p>These tiny inhabitants are so small that they can’t think much on
their own. They can barely hold onto a minimal unit of information, a
small piece of data, something as simple as a number from 0 to 9 or a
letter. They are rather clumsy on their own, but they can communicate
with each other. In groups, they can form words or even images.</p>
<p>Within the buildings, people gather to create ‘mental models.’ These
models are ideas and concepts formed by connecting with notions we
already know. They are always a work in progress: under construction,
undergoing repairs or even being demolished. The city is in constant
transformation and the models change shape.</p>
<p>Because the population is immense (approximately billions), they
often form neighborhoods to develop concise ideas. Some of these
neighborhoods connect with each other through streets and alleyways,
linking models and creating larger and more complex ones.</p>
<p>In this city, you can reach anywhere as long as you are oriented and
know the way. The streets that connect the vast urban area vary; some
are fast, built with concrete, while others are rustic and abandoned,
making navigation challenging. The city administration is responsible
for these roads. When it notices a street is frequently used, it decides
to pave it to improve traffic flow.</p>
<p>Only a few experienced individuals can navigate the metropolis,
managing tasks such as overseeing changes, organizing neighborhoods, and
more. This work is carried out by our conscious and unconscious states,
which are responsible for reasoning.</p>
<h3 id="a.1.2-neurons">A.1.2 Neurons</h3>
<p>These tiny individuals we are referring to are called
<strong>neurons</strong>.</p>
<p>Neurons are small cells that make up the human brain. They are also
found in other parts of the body, forming the central nervous system.
There are billions of them in each of us. Most of them have the job of
interpreting our senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell),
carrying information from the organs to the brain.</p>
<div style="width: 800px; margin: 5px;">
<p><img src="img/neuron.png" /></p>
<figcaption style="font-size:10px; text-align: center;">
Neuron’s parts
</figcaption>
</div>
<p>They have a particular shape, as seen in the image. They are composed
of a body, arms, and legs. The body (2), also called the soma (the wider
part on the left), mainly contains the nucleus (3) where our DNA is
stored. The legs or dendrites (1) receive signals and are located around
the nucleus. Finally, the axon (4) exits the center and is responsible
for transmitting the signal to other neurons through synaptic buttons.
Considering their parts, it’s evident they have a system to communicate
among themselves, known as <strong>synapses</strong>.</p>
<p>There are various types of these tiny cells, but the ones that matter
most to us are those that perform the “<em>thinking</em>” task.</p>
<h3 id="a.1.3-synapses">A.1.3 Synapses</h3>
<p>Synapses serve as the communication junctions between neurons. These
minute gaps exist in close proximity to the next neuron, yet they never
actually touch. Within these gaps, the axon buttons surround the
dendrites.</p>
<div style="float: left; width: 350px; margin: 5px;">
<p><img src="img/synapse.png" /></p>
<figcaption style="font-size: 10px; text-align: center">
Synapse
</figcaption>
</div>
<p>The interaction among these entities creates intricate networks of
neurons engaged in a continuous “dialogue,” forming thoughts through
electrical or chemical impulses. When one neuron seeks to connect with
the next, it sends a signal, and the receiving neuron transmits it to
the subsequent one, creating a chain until a <em>concept</em>
emerges.</p>
<p>When a group of neurons communicates synchronously, they form an
engram. This can be likened to a house, building, or apartment within
our small city. Here, working in harmony, they construct a small unit of
information that can be used to shape a memory. This connection entirely
relies on the impulses sent from one to another.</p>
<p>As engrams are usually not substantial enough to form complete models
or memories, they maintain pathways or roads connecting to other engrams
in different locations. These pathways are the streets linking
neighborhoods, where energy flows and constructs a vast network of
neurons collaborating. The more activity along these pathways, the
stronger the connection becomes. This process is known as consolidation,
involving the improvement of these pathways. It’s a task that requires
time and resources from the body to accomplish. These neuronal pathways
are responsible for managing memory through the hippocampus.</p>
