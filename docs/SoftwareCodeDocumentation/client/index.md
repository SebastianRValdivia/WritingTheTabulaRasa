# Client app

The client is a web application, build using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with it's tools plus the [quasar](https://quasar.dev/) framework for the UI components.

Unlike the lite version this is heavier, polished and complete, the correct user experience. It's developed separately and connects to the server thought the rest api.

The build can be deploy as a web site from the server or as a stand alone app from electron to run in desktop. Both versions require the back end services to run authentication and connect with other users.
