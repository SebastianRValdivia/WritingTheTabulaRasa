# Configuration

The django configuration is controlled from here, specially in settings.py. This file contains all the options for the system to work, including the database.

Most of the options are set in the .env file in the server directory (1 level above) to simplify the installation.

The urls.py file located here is the root of all the urls (from the api and the lite version).

Finally the field_default_values.py is used in the modules to standardize the possible values of the model fields.
