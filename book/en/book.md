## Preface

When I was a child, my mother asked me to study, and from that moment on, for a long time, I interpreted that task as remembering the answers to a test until passing it. Once I fulfilled my obligation, what I knew would disappear. Then, in my adolescence, I had a semester-long assignment called study techniques, where they instructed me to read, underline, reread, and rewrite what I had underlined. At that moment, I saw it as a way to get better grades, and it worked, but after the exam, I would forget again. History facts turned into meaningless dates, equations became scribbles, and the concepts of my language became hateful words floating in my memory. Still, I passed with very high grades.

It was when I entered engineering university that I understood the damage. I remember the first exams were only for the professors and me to gauge my knowledge level. As soon as I read those questions, I remembered that I had answered them at some point, that I had known them years ago, but now I only felt a certain familiarity, but I didn't know the answer. I got a 20%. As they began to teach, it got worse; I had to understand previous concepts to pass exams, something that never interested me. Besides, the study techniques they taught me didn't work with the vast amount of information I was dealing with. I barely passed, and when I reached the second year, where I needed to remember the notions learned to continue, I failed; everything I had learned the previous year had been forgotten.

I thought I was incapable, that I would never make it, that it was a biological matter, and that my brain was inferior. I dropped out of university. At that time, it seemed like a waste of time. I changed my goals and started working as a barista. Still, my curiosity never faded; there were hundreds of things I wanted to learn, especially programming. With a little encouragement, I decided to sit down on my own to learn more about the field.

With stumbles, errors, and difficulties, programming began to make sense. Not only that, I started to see a pattern in how to learn. I began to watch dynamic tutorials that focused on getting hands-on rather than teaching definitions or complex ideas. When I saw a different way of learning, I felt a new curiosity inside me: How do we learn?

I embarked on the journey to discover other ways of studying. The first task was to search for information on how to achieve it. I saved articles on the internet, bought books that interested me (more than I needed), asked people online, among many other things, to discover what I had to do. I experimented with what I got, especially to learn how to program; some attempts to learn failed, others did not. I continued to refine my learning skills until I gained confidence and tried an educational institution again. This time, I didn't fail. Each year was more productive; I knew even more than my peers and even some professors. Everyone thought I was simply "smart" or had more willpower or more time; they were wrong; I just knew how to study correctly.

Over time, I noticed that my comprehension skills improved. I got bored studying only one topic; I went for two or three at a time. I learned about programming, language, carpentry, electricity, electronics, mathematics, and many other disciplines; several of which I didn't even know why I was learning, like beekeeping, horticulture, drawing. It was easy for me, and I liked it, so I kept doing it.

The important thing is that I never stopped learning how to learn. I reached a point where I decided to combine what I knew, what I was taught, and what I discovered on my own to help others achieve their goals.

Why do we learn? People associate learning with institutions, degrees, and work. No one considers doing it for oneself. Learning teaches us new values, develops our ethics. Learning new trades or hobbies makes us productive; learning about our history teaches us not to make the same mistakes, and so on. Learning doesn't make us smarter; it makes us better people.

Studying is a skill that develops in us from childhood. Babies manage to say their first words after hearing their parents' voices repeatedly, and from then on, for the rest of their lives, everything they see and experience is stored in their memory. They will go to school, and just by observing the teacher, they will learn new knowledge. They will see other children playing a game and learn to play it. They will read a book and remember its plot. This child will develop different ways of learning and retaining information.
