## Preface

As a child, my mother urged me to study, and for a considerable stretch of my life, I regarded this task as the mere memorization of answers to exams, only to promptly forget them once the obligation was fulfilled. It wasn't until my teenage years that I encountered a semester-long course called 'study techniques.' Here, I was instructed to read, underline, reread, and rewrite my underlined notes. While this method improved my exam scores temporarily, the knowledge would invariably fade away afterward. Historical facts became meaningless dates, equations dissolved into scribbles, and once-learned language concepts transformed into loathsome words drifting in my memory. Remarkably, I continued to pass with excellent grades.

However, my understanding of the true cost of this approach only dawned on me when I entered engineering university. The initial exams were designed merely to assess my knowledge level, but when I read the questions, I recognized them from somewhere in my past. I had known them years ago, but now they seemed vaguely familiar, and I struggled to provide the correct answers. My score? A mere 20%. As the coursework advanced, my situation deteriorated. I needed to grasp earlier concepts to excel in exams, a prospect that had never piqued my interest. Moreover, the study techniques that had served me previously proved inadequate in the face of the substantial amount of information I now encountered. I barely managed to pass, and by the time I reached my second year, where retaining previously learned concepts was essential, I faltered. Everything I had learned the prior year had vanished from memory.

I began to doubt my abilities, believing I was inherently incapable and that my brain was somehow inferior. I ultimately abandoned my university studies, deeming them a waste of time. My goals shifted, and I started working as a barista. However, my thirst for knowledge remained unquenched. Numerous subjects, particularly programming, continued to captivate my interest. Encouraged by this spark, I decided to embark on a self-guided journey to deepen my understanding of the field.

This path was fraught with stumbling blocks, errors, and challenges, but gradually, programming started to make sense. Beyond that, I began to discern a pattern in the learning process. I turned to dynamic tutorials that emphasized hands-on experience over the rote memorization of definitions or complex theories. This new approach kindled a fresh curiosity within me: How do we learn?

I set out on a quest to uncover alternative methods of studying. My initial task was to gather information on effective study techniques. I scoured the internet for articles, acquired books of interest (often more than necessary), consulted online communities, and experimented extensively. My endeavors to learn programming proved particularly illuminating; while some approaches failed, others succeeded. I persisted in refining my learning skills until I gained the confidence to reattempt formal education. This time, I did not falter. Each passing year proved more productive, and I found myself surpassing both my peers and even some of my professors. Many attributed my success to sheer intelligence, willpower, or time spent studying. Yet, they were mistaken; I had simply mastered the art of effective learning.

Over time, I noticed a significant enhancement in my comprehension abilities. I grew restless studying a single topic and began to tackle two or three simultaneously. I explored diverse disciplines, from programming and languages to carpentry, electricity, electronics, mathematics, and many others, including seemingly unrelated subjects like beekeeping and horticulture. This multifaceted approach felt effortless and enjoyable, compelling me to continue my eclectic learning journey.

What remains paramount is my unwavering commitment to learning how to learn. I reached a juncture where I amalgamated my accumulated knowledge, formal education, and independent discoveries to assist others in achieving their learning goals.

But why do we learn? Often, people associate learning with institutions, degrees, and job prospects, neglecting the value of learning for its intrinsic worth. Learning instills new values, nurtures our ethics, enhances our productivity by acquainting us with new trades and hobbies, imparts wisdom from history to prevent repeating past mistakes, and so much more. Learning doesn't merely boost our intelligence; it shapes us into better individuals.

From infancy, we begin to cultivate the skill of learning. Babies utter their first words after repeated exposure to their parents' voices, and this process continues throughout their lives. Schooling exposes them to new knowledge simply by observing teachers, acquainting them with games by watching peers, and etching book plots into their memory through reading. This childhood development lays the foundation for various learning styles and information retention techniques.

## Abstract

Within the pages of this book, we embark on a profound exploration of the intricacies of learning, delving deep into the modus operandi of our minds. Our mission is to unravel the secrets of understanding and memorizing information with the ultimate goal of enhancing our cognitive capabilities and extracting knowledge in the most lucid and meticulously organized manner.

In this quest for cognitive mastery, we encounter a rich tapestry of methods and intricate systems meticulously crafted by experts. These tools serve as catalysts, propelling us toward heightened efficacy in our learning endeavors. Learning, as we come to appreciate, transcends the mere act of reading; it demands an amalgamation of willpower, strategic finesse, relentless practice, and the wisdom to discern the most effective pathways to knowledge acquisition.

The voyage of recollection, an integral facet of the learning process, unfolds as a cyclic odyssey, replete with twists and turns, for which we must be well-prepared. Once we acquire knowledge, our brains undergo transformative processes akin to molding clay into new forms. However, this remarkable property of neuroplasticity comes with its own set of challenges. The specter of forgetting looms, albeit not indefinitely or abruptly. Under specific conditions, the precious fruits of our learning can slip away. To combat this formidable adversary, we wield a powerful weapon: the art of notation. Within our arsenal, we find an array of mechanisms, both simple and intricate, swift or detailed, all finely tuned to transcribe information with precision and purpose.

For those who may question the efficacy of the written word, there exists an alternative avenue of learning: the art of meticulously crafting organized visualizations. Diagramming, as we shall discover, demands an intimate understanding of the nuanced art of explicit and systematic description within a pristine canvas of blank space. Yet, be not deceived, for the mere act of tracing lines upon a canvas is insufficient to conjure meaningful charts and diagrams. What lies at the heart of this endeavor is an adherence to order and an unwavering dedication to the art's guiding principles and regulations.

In essence, this odyssey through the realms of learning not only equips us with the tools to ascend the peaks of knowledge but also instills a profound sense of reverence for the process itself. Learning, we come to realize, transcends the confines of institutions, degrees, and employment prospects. It is the crucible in which we forge our values, nurture our ethics, and expand our horizons. Learning transforms us into not just more intelligent beings but, fundamentally, into better individuals.

### ¿What is "tabula rasa"?

The term "tabula rasa," Latin for "blank slate," carries profound philosophical significance. It encapsulates the notion that each of us enters the world devoid of inherent knowledge, akin to an empty canvas, and it is through the journey of life that we inscribe our experiences upon this mental canvas, gradually etching the tapestry of our understanding.

The origin of this term draws a compelling parallel to a tool of antiquity—the Roman wax tablet. Employed by the Romans in the 1st century B.C., this tablet could be molded afresh with a stylus, permitting the erasure of previous writings and enabling the opportunity to transcribe anew. Its very emptiness led to its designation as "rasa," signifying the absence of preexisting inscriptions.

In essence, "tabula rasa" stands as a testament to the malleability of human consciousness, where the imprints of life's experiences continually shape and reshape the contours of our understanding, rendering each of us a unique work of intellectual artistry.

Philosophers employed this expression to symbolize the commencement of learning from birth, following the theory of empiricism, which posits that we acquire knowledge through experience from the moment we are born. Here, we align ourselves with this ideology, keeping our doors open to all. What is explained remains indifferent to one's origin, current circumstances, reasons for wanting to learn, or any other factors.
