## Preface

As a child, my mother urged me to study, and for a considerable stretch of my life, I regarded this task as the mere memorization of answers to exams, only to promptly forget them once the obligation was fulfilled. It wasn't until my teenage years that I encountered a semester-long course called 'study techniques.' Here, I was instructed to read, underline, reread, and rewrite my underlined notes. While this method improved my exam scores temporarily, the knowledge would invariably fade away afterward. Historical facts became meaningless dates, equations dissolved into scribbles, and once-learned language concepts transformed into loathsome words drifting in my memory. Remarkably, I continued to pass with excellent grades.

However, my understanding of the true cost of this approach only dawned on me when I entered engineering university. The initial exams were designed merely to assess my knowledge level, but when I read the questions, I recognized them from somewhere in my past. I had known them years ago, but now they seemed vaguely familiar, and I struggled to provide the correct answers. My score? A mere 20%. As the coursework advanced, my situation deteriorated. I needed to grasp earlier concepts to excel in exams, a prospect that had never piqued my interest. Moreover, the study techniques that had served me previously proved inadequate in the face of the substantial amount of information I now encountered. I barely managed to pass, and by the time I reached my second year, where retaining previously learned concepts was essential, I faltered. Everything I had learned the prior year had vanished from memory.

I began to doubt my abilities, believing I was inherently incapable and that my brain was somehow inferior. I ultimately abandoned my university studies, deeming them a waste of time. My goals shifted, and I started working as a barista. However, my thirst for knowledge remained unquenched. Numerous subjects, particularly programming, continued to captivate my interest. Encouraged by this spark, I decided to embark on a self-guided journey to deepen my understanding of the field.

This path was fraught with stumbling blocks, errors, and challenges, but gradually, programming started to make sense. Beyond that, I began to discern a pattern in the learning process. I turned to dynamic tutorials that emphasized hands-on experience over the rote memorization of definitions or complex theories. This new approach kindled a fresh curiosity within me: How do we learn?

I set out on a quest to uncover alternative methods of studying. My initial task was to gather information on effective study techniques. I scoured the internet for articles, acquired books of interest (often more than necessary), consulted online communities, and experimented extensively. My endeavors to learn programming proved particularly illuminating; while some approaches failed, others succeeded. I persisted in refining my learning skills until I gained the confidence to reattempt formal education. This time, I did not falter. Each passing year proved more productive, and I found myself surpassing both my peers and even some of my professors. Many attributed my success to sheer intelligence, willpower, or time spent studying. Yet, they were mistaken; I had simply mastered the art of effective learning.

Over time, I noticed a significant enhancement in my comprehension abilities. I grew restless studying a single topic and began to tackle two or three simultaneously. I explored diverse disciplines, from programming and languages to carpentry, electricity, electronics, mathematics, and many others, including seemingly unrelated subjects like beekeeping and horticulture. This multifaceted approach felt effortless and enjoyable, compelling me to continue my eclectic learning journey.

What remains paramount is my unwavering commitment to learning how to learn. I reached a juncture where I amalgamated my accumulated knowledge, formal education, and independent discoveries to assist others in achieving their learning goals.

But why do we learn? Often, people associate learning with institutions, degrees, and job prospects, neglecting the value of learning for its intrinsic worth. Learning instills new values, nurtures our ethics, enhances our productivity by acquainting us with new trades and hobbies, imparts wisdom from history to prevent repeating past mistakes, and so much more. Learning doesn't merely boost our intelligence; it shapes us into better individuals.

From infancy, we begin to cultivate the skill of learning. Babies utter their first words after repeated exposure to their parents' voices, and this process continues throughout their lives. Schooling exposes them to new knowledge simply by observing teachers, acquainting them with games by watching peers, and etching book plots into their memory through reading. This childhood development lays the foundation for various learning styles and information retention techniques.

## Abstract

Within the pages of this book, we embark on a profound exploration of the intricacies of learning, delving deep into the modus operandi of our minds. Our mission is to unravel the secrets of understanding and memorizing information with the ultimate goal of enhancing our cognitive capabilities and extracting knowledge in the most lucid and meticulously organized manner.

In this quest for cognitive mastery, we encounter a rich tapestry of methods and intricate systems meticulously crafted by experts. These tools serve as catalysts, propelling us toward heightened efficacy in our learning endeavors. Learning, as we come to appreciate, transcends the mere act of reading; it demands an amalgamation of willpower, strategic finesse, relentless practice, and the wisdom to discern the most effective pathways to knowledge acquisition.

The voyage of recollection, an integral facet of the learning process, unfolds as a cyclic odyssey, replete with twists and turns, for which we must be well-prepared. Once we acquire knowledge, our brains undergo transformative processes akin to molding clay into new forms. However, this remarkable property of neuroplasticity comes with its own set of challenges. The specter of forgetting looms, albeit not indefinitely or abruptly. Under specific conditions, the precious fruits of our learning can slip away. To combat this formidable adversary, we wield a powerful weapon: the art of notation. Within our arsenal, we find an array of mechanisms, both simple and intricate, swift or detailed, all finely tuned to transcribe information with precision and purpose.

For those who may question the efficacy of the written word, there exists an alternative avenue of learning: the art of meticulously crafting organized visualizations. Diagramming, as we shall discover, demands an intimate understanding of the nuanced art of explicit and systematic description within a pristine canvas of blank space. Yet, be not deceived, for the mere act of tracing lines upon a canvas is insufficient to conjure meaningful charts and diagrams. What lies at the heart of this endeavor is an adherence to order and an unwavering dedication to the art's guiding principles and regulations.

In essence, this odyssey through the realms of learning not only equips us with the tools to ascend the peaks of knowledge but also instills a profound sense of reverence for the process itself. Learning, we come to realize, transcends the confines of institutions, degrees, and employment prospects. It is the crucible in which we forge our values, nurture our ethics, and expand our horizons. Learning transforms us into not just more intelligent beings but, fundamentally, into better individuals.

### ¿What is "tabula rasa"?

The term "tabula rasa," Latin for "blank slate," carries profound philosophical significance. It encapsulates the notion that each of us enters the world devoid of inherent knowledge, akin to an empty canvas, and it is through the journey of life that we inscribe our experiences upon this mental canvas, gradually etching the tapestry of our understanding.

The origin of this term draws a compelling parallel to a tool of antiquity—the Roman wax tablet. Employed by the Romans in the 1st century B.C., this tablet could be molded afresh with a stylus, permitting the erasure of previous writings and enabling the opportunity to transcribe anew. Its very emptiness led to its designation as "rasa," signifying the absence of preexisting inscriptions.

In essence, "tabula rasa" stands as a testament to the malleability of human consciousness, where the imprints of life's experiences continually shape and reshape the contours of our understanding, rendering each of us a unique work of intellectual artistry.

</div>

Philosophers employed this expression to symbolize the commencement of learning from birth, following the theory of empiricism, which posits that we acquire knowledge through experience from the moment we are born. Here, we align ourselves with this ideology, keeping our doors open to all. What is explained remains indifferent to one's origin, current circumstances, reasons for wanting to learn, or any other factors.

## General view

Writing the Tabula Rasa is a metaphorical title for the content we will delve into. Firstly, we will approach it's figurative meaning, aiming to comprehend how the human mind operates and how individuals acquire knowledge. After this metaphorical exploration, we will take a literal approach and craft the 'table' creating a record of our knowledge to facilitate recollection and interpretation by others.

The text is structured into three primary sections, each addressing key questions: How does our brain function? How do we learn and memorize it's concepts? And, lastly, how do we disseminate and organize this information?

In the first section, we will delve into the biology of neurons, dissecting their components and understanding how they interconnect to construct mental models. We will also explore the concept of 'attention' and the pivotal role of cultivating effective study habits.

The second section delves into the realms of study, memorization, and information retrieval. This domain is vast and intricate, reliant on the application of techniques across a process that leads to the comprehension and interconnection of concepts, culminating in their retention within memory. This journey takes time and cannot be accomplished in a single night.

Finally, we elucidate the process of disseminating information to make it reusable, both for oneself and others. We analyze the abstract organization of information, emphasize the importance of precision in writing and present various methods for articulating ideas effectively.

I have endeavored to present this book in an accessible manner, though it may still pose challenges for those less accustomed to extensive reading. Whether you are an expert or a novice, remember: strive to maintain a holistic perspective. Keep in mind the previously discussed topics and return to them as needed. Comprehending the connections is paramount to grasping the underpinnings of more advanced sections.

# A. Understanding the mind

The human brain is the most intricate organ in the animal kingdom, brimming with mysteries that have intrigued various disciplines dedicated to unraveling them. The task of thinking is carried out by tiny, specialized cells that work together in a structured and organized manner, much like bees. Each area of this remarkable organ performs a highly specific function.

But why should we be interested in knowing this? This is where knowledge is brewed. Understanding how it functions enables us to comprehend how it operates, what it's limits are and how it thinks. However, the goal is not to become neuroscientists; people can drive a vehicle without being mechanics.

We will explore the composition of the brain at the cellular level as it forms systems, eventually culminating in something larger. We will focus on an organic perspective before delving into the workings of what we will cover in the second part.

## A.1 How does the brain work?

The first step in comprehending the mind is to delve into the neuronal system within our brain, which enables us to think, remember, and understand. This peculiar organ located in our head is composed of several parts, each serving various functions. Nonetheless, our focus isn't on knowing each part individually but rather on how they come together to form the human mind.

Before delving into the biological aspects, we will employ an analogy to ease the complexity, allowing us to perceive the operations of our brain from a different perspective.

### A.1.1 A tiny city

Imagine the mind as a miniature, microscopic city inside your head, complete with people, streets and buildings.

These tiny inhabitants are so small that they can't think much on their own. They can barely hold onto a minimal unit of information, a small piece of data, something as simple as a number from 0 to 9 or a letter. They are rather clumsy on their own, but they can communicate with each other. In groups, they can form words or even images.

Within the buildings, people gather to create 'mental models.' These models are ideas and concepts formed by connecting with notions we already know. They are always a work in progress: under construction, undergoing repairs or even being demolished. The city is in constant transformation and the models change shape.

Because the population is immense (approximately billions), they often form neighborhoods to develop concise ideas. Some of these neighborhoods connect with each other through streets and alleyways, linking models and creating larger and more complex ones.

In this city, you can reach anywhere as long as you are oriented and know the way. The streets that connect the vast urban area vary; some are fast, built with concrete, while others are rustic and abandoned, making navigation challenging. The city administration is responsible for these roads. When it notices a street is frequently used, it decides to pave it to improve traffic flow.

Only a few experienced individuals can navigate the metropolis, managing tasks such as overseeing changes, organizing neighborhoods, and more. This work is carried out by our conscious and unconscious states, which are responsible for reasoning.

### A.1.2 Neurons

These tiny individuals we are referring to are called **neurons**.

Neurons are small cells that make up the human brain. They are also found in other parts of the body, forming the central nervous system. There are billions of them in each of us. Most of them have the job of interpreting our senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), carrying information from the organs to the brain.

<div style="width: 800px; margin: 5px;">

  ![](img/neuron.png)

  <figcaption style="font-size:10px; text-align: center;">Neuron's parts</figcaption>

</div>

They have a particular shape, as seen in the image. They are composed of a body, arms, and legs. The body (2), also called the soma (the wider part on the left), mainly contains the nucleus (3) where our DNA is stored. The legs or dendrites (1) receive signals and are located around the nucleus. Finally, the axon (4) exits the center and is responsible for transmitting the signal to other neurons through synaptic buttons. Considering their parts, it's evident they have a system to communicate among themselves, known as **synapses**.

There are various types of these tiny cells, but the ones that matter most to us are those that perform the "*thinking*" task.

### A.1.3 Synapses

Synapses serve as the communication junctions between neurons. These minute gaps exist in close proximity to the next neuron, yet they never actually touch. Within these gaps, the axon buttons surround the dendrites.

<div style="float: left; width: 350px; margin: 5px;">

  ![](img/synapse.png)
  
  <figcaption style="font-size: 10px; text-align: center">Synapse</figcaption>

</div>

The interaction among these entities creates intricate networks of neurons engaged in a continuous "dialogue," forming thoughts through electrical or chemical impulses. When one neuron seeks to connect with the next, it sends a signal, and the receiving neuron transmits it to the subsequent one, creating a chain until a *concept* emerges.

When a group of neurons communicates synchronously, they form an engram. This can be likened to a house, building, or apartment within our small city. Here, working in harmony, they construct a small unit of information that can be used to shape a memory. This connection entirely relies on the impulses sent from one to another.

As engrams are usually not substantial enough to form complete models or memories, they maintain pathways or roads connecting to other engrams in different locations. These pathways are the streets linking neighborhoods, where energy flows and constructs a vast network of neurons collaborating. The more activity along these pathways, the stronger the connection becomes. This process is known as consolidation, involving the improvement of these pathways. It's a task that requires time and resources from the body to accomplish. These neuronal pathways are responsible for managing memory through the hippocampus.

### A.1.4 Hippocampus

The hippocampus is a part of the brain where a significant portion of memory-related tasks takes place. It is named after its resemblance to the seahorse. This organ can be thought of as the city's computing center.

It is responsible for remembering facts, events, and orientation tasks. It possesses a substantial amount of gray matter where axons lack myelin, which makes it slower but capable of processing information. Due to its structure, which is composed of somewhat different neurons, it is considered the site where 'reasoning' often occurs. For this reason, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in reasoning and the formation of abstract mental models.

In summary, the hippocampus is a crucial hub for memory processes in the brain and deserves a word. It's responsible for encoding new information, consolidating it into long-term memory, linking related memories, and facilitating their retrieval. Without the hippocampus, our ability to form and recall memories would be significantly impaired, making it an essential and fascinating part of our cognitive system.

### A.1.5 Neuroplasticity

Similar to the dynamics in our miniature city, the brain is in constant flux, a phenomenon known as **neuroplasticity**. This is the time when construction work takes place.

This characteristic states that our brain can adapt and create new connections between neurons. This is why we describe the mind as reconstructive and involving multiple processes to transform itself.

Without this attribute, the brain would be fixed and unchanging, much like that of an insect. It would always perform the same basic tasks, such as eating, or perhaps a few more complex yet essential and routine ones.

This change doesn't happen overnight, nor is it extraordinary. It's akin to a plant's growth from sprout to fruit, taking months of effort. It's during the night when it grows the most. This transformation necessitates healthy habits, which we will explore in A.4.1 (Mental Health).
